        <p class = 'orders-paragraph'>First and foremost, this site should help make it easier for orders to be made. It should showcase the products and give them names and ingredient lists so that the customers can more easily find what they are looking for, whether they have had some of Lucy’s products before or if they are trying them for the first time. It should help people know what it is they are ordering, and that it is safe with any food restrictions or allergies that they may have. Lucy may also be starting to make gluten free bread very soon, and this website will increase the likelihood that people that have that restriction will be able to realize that it is an option for them.</p>

        <h2 class = 'publicity-heading'>Publicity</h2>
        <p class = 'publicity-paragragh'>This website will also work to showcase Lucy’s products. They have not received much publicity, because she is simply selling her products on Facebook at the moment. I intend for this website to work as a testament of Lucy’s work and her products, and I am planning on using reviews that people have left in the past as evidence of that. This site should help increase the amount of people who see and try Lucy’s products, and hopefully more reviews will come, causing it’s popularity to continue to spread. </p>
