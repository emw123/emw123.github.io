      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Haven’t you ever wished that it was easier to buy good products from small businesses? The customers of Lucy’s Loaves certainly do. Lucy’s Loaves is a new bread selling business. Lucy, the owner, is the only employee, so the product production is very slow. People love her bread, and I would like to make it easier to sell and buy her product by building a website for her business. This will make it much easier to see what is available and to make orders.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will be those who already buy Lucy's bread, and hopefully other people who are interested in or love homemade bread. It will be adults who have families, because that has made up the majority of her buyers in the past. The website will also hopefully serve as an advertisment towards new people who show interest. It will provide a way for Lucy's products to be seen by more people who might be interested in them.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h2>What This Site Is:</h2>
      <h2>Easier Access</h2>
      <p>This site is a way for patrons of Lucy’s Loaves to have easier access to her products, and to make it easier for them to pay her for her services. It is meant to help make Lucy’s Loaves more widely available and more widely known. It is meant to support Lucy and her business and to spread awareness that this wonderful business and these incredible products exist and that they are available to be bought. </p>
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Lucy’s Loaves goal as a business is to provide delicious homemade bread to those who want it. The mission of the owner is to help people have access to these things, and to provide only products that are of the highest quality. Lucy herself does this because she loves to bake, and has been doing it since she was very small. More recently she decided that she wanted to share her love of baking with others, and she started to sell her products off of Facebook. The goal of this website is to help her continue to share that love, and to be able to do it in a way that is much more widespread.</p>

      <h2>Who This Site Is For</h2>
      <h2>Lucy</h2>
      <p>This site is for Lucy. Lucy is my sister, and she has worked very hard to make this business a reality. This is site is being built so that her efforts will continue to be noticed, and so that more people will begin to realize that she has done this incredible thing. This business is so amazing because at the moment, Lucy is only twelve years old, and she is already partially running her own business. She has begun to achieve something that many grown adults struggle to begin. This site is a way to showcase her success as well as her wonderful products, and to help her gain more publicity so that her business can continue to grow along with her.</p>
      <h2>The Customers</h2>
      <p>This site is also for Lucy’s customers. Many people have expressed their love for Lucy’s products, and have even requested certain items to be made again over Facebook. This site will help the customers to put in orders in a way that is easier for Lucy to see, so that she can work to provide these customers with what they want, and so that they have an easier way of accessing those products that she works so diligently to make. </p>

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <section>
        <h2>How It Should Work</h2>
        <h2>Orders</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, this site should help make it easier for orders to be made. It should showcase the products and give them names and ingredient lists so that the customers can more easily find what they are looking for, whether they have had some of Lucy’s products before or if they are trying them for the first time. It should help people know what it is they are ordering, and that it is safe with any food restrictions or allergies that they may have. Lucy may also be starting to make gluten free bread very soon, and this website will increase the likelihood that people that have that restriction will be able to realize that it is an option for them.</p>
        <h2>Publicity</h2>
        <p>This website will also work to showcase Lucy’s products. They have not received much publicity, because she is simply selling her products on Facebook at the moment. I intend for this website to work as a testament of Lucy’s work and her products, and I am planning on using reviews that people have left in the past as evidence of that. This site should help increase the amount of people who see and try Lucy’s products, and hopefully more reviews will come, causing it’s popularity to continue to spread. </p>
