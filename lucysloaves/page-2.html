This is site is being built so that her efforts will continue to be noticed, and so that more people will begin to realize that she has done this incredible thing. This business is so amazing because at the moment, Lucy is only twelve years old, and she is already partially running her own business. She has begun to achieve something that many grown adults struggle to begin. This site is a way to showcase her success as well as her wonderful products, and to help her gain more publicity so that her business can continue to grow along with her.</p>
